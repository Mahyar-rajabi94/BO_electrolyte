BO function:

Input: 
df-contains all previous data, include newly tested ones and training set

Output:
new (x) composition: e.g. (1, 5, 27, 67)


BO properties:
- sample space: 4 -> K, Na, Cs, Li
- mixing resolution: 1%
- Noise level: 5% (error from the sensor)


Physical layer workflow:

initialization (activate the cell) K
calibration (calibrate the sensor) Na
find the calibrated line

BO(based on training data, make the first suggestion)-> comp 1

runcell (comp 1) -> 7000PPB

calibrate result(7000PPB) -> generate new PPB

label the new data point that was tested

cleaning()

BO(updated df with new label) -> suggest new comp

runcell(*new comp from BO)

repeat...
